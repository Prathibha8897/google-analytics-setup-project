**Chrome Developer Tools**: For verifying tag firing.
### 📝 What I Did (Step-by-Step)
1. **Website Deployment:** Built and published "BloomCafe," a mock coffee shop landing page.
2. **GA4 Configuration:** Created a new GA4 property and web data stream.
3. **Integration:** Manually implemented the Measurement ID (`G-YQ021NRQH1`) into the site header.
4. **Verification:** Tested real-time data flow using mobile and desktop devices.
5. **Debugging:** Solved a "Data Collection Inactive" error by forcing a site republish to trigger the new tags.

### 📈 Results & Evidence
* **Status:** Live & Tracking.
* **Verification:** Confirmed 2 real-time users across different device types (Mobile + Desktop).

### 💡 Key Learnings
- Learned the difference between "Reports Snapshot" (historical) and "Realtime" (live).
- Understood how browser caching and "Draft" modes can block analytics tags from firing.
- Gained experience in debugging tag implementation issues.
